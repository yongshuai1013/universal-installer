# Universal Installer — Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-04-26

## v1.4.1 — Hotfix (urgent)

v1.4.0 shipped a regression that broke APK installs on at least Android 15 / Motorola.
A hotfix is required before any new feature work.

| 1 | [#12](https://github.com/.../issues/12)           | **P0 bug** | "Unknown package" since v1.4.0. Likely caused by `ab50725` (migrate to multiple activities) — the new activity layout probably lost an `intent-filter` for `application/vnd.android.package-archive` + `content://` / `file://` schemes, or the `PackageInstaller` session is created against the wrong activity context. |
| 2 | [#11](https://github.com/.../issues/11)           | P1 bug     | Shizuku "replace existing" toggle does nothing. Verify the `-r` flag is forwarded to `pm install` in the Shizuku backend path.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 3 | [#3 (icon part)](https://github.com/.../issues/3) | P2 bug     | Missing app icon on some screen. Check `loadIcon()` vs `loadUnbadgedIcon()` and adaptive-icon fallback.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

**Release as `versionCode = 6`, `versionName = "1.4.1"`.**

## v1.5.0 — Feature release

Self-contained features, no external dependencies (no OAuth review, no Play Services).

## v1.6.1 — Bigger bets

| Cloud backup (Google Drive only, first) | community #2                          | L      | AppAuth, not Play Services SDK, to keep F-Droid build viable. **Start Google OAuth verification the day v1.5.0 ships** — that's the long pole. |
| Default installer system-wide           | [#5](https://github.com/.../issues/5) | M      | Intent-filter priority work + onboarding flow to set as default handler. Pairs with the #12 intent-filter audit.                               |

## Backlog — needs discovery before scoping

- **"Open Android" advocacy & strategic defense** ([#13](https://github.com/.../issues/13), [#31](https://github.com/.../issues/31)). Take a public stance against Google's increasing sideloading restrictions (developer verification mandates). Maintain ADB/Shizuku/Root as resilient installation paths that bypass standard PackageInstaller blocks.
- **Sandbox / isolated install** ([#3](https://github.com/.../issues/3)). Real sandboxing on stock Android is hard. Options to spike: Work Profile API, Island/Shelter integration, custom user via root. Don't promise a release date until an approach is validated.
- **Different notification/interaction forms** ([#5](https://github.com/.../issues/5), one of several). Reporter was vague; ask for a concrete example before scoping.
- **Additional cloud providers** (Dropbox, OneDrive). Defer until Drive ships and we see usage.

---

## Working agreement

- Hotfixes ship as `versionCode +1`, patch version bump.
- Feature releases bundle 3–5 items so changelogs stay readable.
- F-Droid reproducibility constraint: any new SDK must work without Google Play Services, or be flavor-gated.
