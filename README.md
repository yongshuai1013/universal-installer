  <h1>Universal Installer</h1>
  <p><strong>Universal Installer</strong> is a modern Android package manager that handles what the default installer can't.</p>
  <p>Install <strong>APK, APK+, APKS, XAPK, APKM</strong> (with split APKs and OBB files), download packages from URLs, manage installed apps, and silent-install via Shizuku — all in one Material 3 app.</p>

## Features

### Visuals & UX

* **Expressive UI** — Beautiful, bouncy spring animations (inspired by InstallerX-Revived) that make the dialog card "living" and responsive.
* **Brand Identity** — Sleek default Orange theme for a premium, high-contrast look (Dynamic Color still available as an option).

### Install

* **Multi-format** — `.apk`, `.apk+`, `.apks`, `.xapk`, `.apkm` with split APK handling (via [Ackpine](https://ackpine.solrudev.ru/))
* **Merge split APKs** — Group multiple individual `.apk` files (e.g. from a manual split extraction) into a single installation session. Perfect for installing apps served as a collection of separate splits.
* **Modern Android Support** — Fully compatible with **Android 14, 15, 16**, and ready for **Android 17**. Fixes common parsing errors (e.g. `aconfig_flags.pb`) found on newer system versions.
* **Package preview** — App name, icon, version, package, size, min/target SDK, supported ABIs, languages, permissions, OBB count, split count — shown in a bottom sheet before you commit
* **Three local pick modes** — Find automatic (scans device storage), Browse packages (APK/XAPK/APKS/APKM only), Browse all files
* **Remote download** — Paste a URL, download package directly. Files land in `/sdcard/Download/UniversalInstaller/` with their Content-Disposition name so they're easy to re-find in any file manager
* **Download history** — Every download is logged; re-install later, copy the source URL, or delete from the dedicated history screen
* **Intent handling** — Open APK/XAPK files from Chrome downloads, Gmail attachments, Telegram, or any file manager — even when the URL has no extension

### OBB support

* **Bundle-embedded OBBs** — XAPK/APKM/APKS archives containing `.obb` files are auto-detected and copied to `Android/obb/<package>/` after the APK installs
* **Standalone attach** — Pick a base APK, then attach one or more `.obb` files via the preview sheet; they're installed alongside
* **Runs in a foreground worker** — OBB copy survives app closure, with progress on the notification shade
* **Three write strategies** — Falls back in order based on what the device permits:
  1. Direct I/O (pre-Android 11)
  2. Shizuku (`shell` UID can write to any app's OBB dir on modern Android)
  3. SAF tree grant (user grants access to `Android/obb/<pkg>/` once per package; reused on subsequent installs)

### Security

* **VirusTotal integration** — Auto SHA-256 hash lookup on every picked file; if VirusTotal doesn't know the file yet, optionally upload it for a full multi-engine scan (supports files up to 650 MB via VirusTotal's large-file endpoint)
* **Clear verdict** — See engine counts (malicious / suspicious / harmless / undetected) before you install

### Shizuku & Root power-user features

When Root access or Shizuku is enabled, unlocks:

* **Installer Profiles** — Save and reuse custom install configurations (installer package spoofing, privileged flags, targeted users) per app or globally.
* **Silent install / uninstall** — No system confirmation prompt
* **Replace existing**, **Allow downgrade**, **Grant all requested permissions**, **Allow test packages**, **Bypass low target SDK block**, **Install for all users**
* **Set install source** — Spoof the installer package name (Google Play, Aurora, F-Droid, Amazon, Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi presets, or custom) so apps with "installed from Play Store" checks accept your sideload

### Sync & Share (LAN File Server)

* **Built-in HTTP server** — Share and manage your packages across a local Wi-Fi network from any browser
* **Web dashboard** — Download APKs straight to your PC or upload new packages directly to your phone
* **Live tracking** — Real-time progress updates visible inside the app as files transfer
* **PIN security** — Set an optional 4–8 digit PIN code to restrict local access to your shared folder

### Uninstall / app manager

* **Full app list** — Browse user apps (system apps optional)
* **Rich metadata** — App name, package, version, APK size, first install date, last used time
* **Sort** — By Name / Size / Installed date / Last used — each with ascending/descending toggle
* **Batch select** — Long-press to enter selection mode, uninstall many at once
* **Filter sheet** — Tap FAB for sort/filter options; long-press FAB to scroll to top
* **Usage access hint** — "Last used" sort prompts user to grant the Usage Access permission only when needed
* **Uninstall logs** — Separate log screen for every uninstall attempt (success / failure with reason)

### Device utilities

* **Storage card on Install screen** — At-a-glance internal storage usage (free / total, color-coded warning at 75% / 90%)
* **Install history** — Every install attempt logged with app name, package, version, success/failure, and error reason

### Other

* **Material 3** — Orange brand theme (default) + Dynamic color + Light / Dark / System theme
* **Multi-language** — Arabic, German, Greek, English, Spanish, French, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (BR), Russian, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Chinese
* **Progress notifications** — Download, install, and OBB copy all surface their progress in the notification shade

---

## Tech Stack

* **Kotlin** + **Jetpack Compose** — UI
* **[Ackpine](https://ackpine.solrudev.ru/)** — Package install/uninstall with split APK, Shizuku, and libsu plugins
* **[Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/)** — Privileged operations via ADB/root
* **Ktor** — HTTP client for VirusTotal and remote downloads
* **WorkManager** — Foreground worker for OBB copy (survives app process death)
* **Room** — Local DB for install / uninstall / download history
* **Koin** — Dependency injection
* **DataStore** — Preferences storage
* **Coil 3** — App icon loading

---

## Build Instructions

### Requirements

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* Java 17+
* Android SDK 36

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pass-with-high-score/universal-installer.git
   cd universal-installer
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Sync Gradle and run on a device (emulator works for most features except Shizuku-backed install)

### Gradle

Universal Installer uses two product flavors: `store` (F-Droid/Play Store compliant, no bundled Root binaries) and `full` (All features, including Root backend).

```bash
# Debug builds
./gradlew assembleStoreDebug
./gradlew assembleFullDebug

# Release builds
./gradlew assembleStoreRelease
./gradlew assembleFullRelease
```

### Fastlane

```bash
# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Build debug APK
bundle exec fastlane build_debug

# Build release APK
bundle exec fastlane build_release

# Deploy beta to Firebase App Distribution
bundle exec fastlane beta

# Deploy to Play Store internal track
bundle exec fastlane deploy_internal

# Bump version code
bundle exec fastlane bump_version

# Bump version code + name
bundle exec fastlane bump_version version_name:"2.0"
```

## Configuration

### Shizuku (silent install, install source spoofing, OBB copy)

1. Install [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) on your device
2. Start the Shizuku service via ADB (or via the Shizuku app if rooted)
3. Open Universal Installer → **Settings → Installation → Shizuku Backend** → grant permission when prompted
4. Optional: enable **Set install source** to pick the installer package name apps will see

### VirusTotal

1. Get a free API key at [virustotal.com/gui/my-apikey](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/my-apikey)
2. **Settings → Security → VirusTotal API Key** → paste key
3. Every picked APK is hashed and looked up automatically; unknown files can be uploaded on demand from the preview sheet

### Storage permissions (for OBB copy + device scan)

* **Android 11+**: grant **All files access** when prompted (used for `Find automatic` device scan and for the direct-write OBB path). If you decline, OBB copy falls back to Shizuku or a per-package SAF tree grant
* **Pre-Android 11**: falls back to legacy `READ/WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
* **Usage access** (optional, Uninstall screen only): grant when you tap the "Last used" sort option — enables sorting and date metadata per row
